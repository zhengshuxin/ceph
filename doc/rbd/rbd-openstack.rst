 Block Devices and OpenStack
=============================

.. index:: Ceph Block Device; OpenStack

You may use Ceph Block Device images with OpenStack through ``libvirt``, which
configures the QEMU interface to ``librbd``. Ceph stripes block device images as
objects across the cluster, which means that large Ceph Block Device images have
better performance than a standalone server!

To use Ceph Block Devices with OpenStack, you must install QEMU, ``libvirt``,
and OpenStack first. We recommend using a separate physical node for your
OpenStack installation. OpenStack recommends a minimum of 8GB of RAM and a
quad-core processor. The following diagram depicts the OpenStack/Ceph
technology stack.

.. important:: To use Ceph Block Devices with OpenStack, you must have
   access to a running Ceph Storage Cluster.

Three parts of OpenStack integrate with Ceph's block devices:

- **Images**: OpenStack Glance manages images for VMs. Images
  are immutable. OpenStack treats images as binary blobs and
  downloads them accordingly.

- **Volumes**: Volumes are block devices. OpenStack uses volumes
  to boot VMs, or to attach volumes to running VMs. OpenStack manages
  volumes using Cinder services.

- **Guest Disks**: Guest disks are guest operating system disks.
  By default, when you boot a virtual machine,
  its disk appears as a file on the filesystem of the hypervisor
  (usually under ``/var/lib/nova/instances/<uuid>/``). Prior OpenStack
  Havana, the only way to boot a VM in Ceph was to use the boot from volume
  functionality from Cinder. However, now it is possible to
  directly boot every virtual machine inside Ceph without using Cinder.
  This is really handy because it allows us to easily perform
  maintenance operation with the live-migration process.
  On the other hand, if your hypervisor dies it is also really convenient
  to trigger ``nova evacuate`` and almost seamlessly run the virtual machine
  somewhere else.

You can use OpenStack Glance to store images in a Ceph Block Device, and you
can use Cinder to boot a VM using a copy-on-write clone of an image.

The instructions below detail the setup for Glance, Cinder and Nova, although
they do not have to be used together. You may store images in Ceph block devices
while running VMs using a local disk, or vice versa.

.. tip:: This document describes using Ceph Block Devices with OpenStack Havana.
   For earlier versions of OpenStack see
   `Block Devices and OpenStack (Dumpling)`_.

.. index:: pools; OpenStack

Create a Pool
=============

By default, Ceph block devices use the ``rbd`` pool. You may use any available
pool. We recommend creating a pool for Cinder and a pool for Glance. Ensure
your Ceph cluster is running, then create the pools. ::

    ceph osd pool create volumes 128
    ceph osd pool create images 128
    ceph osd pool create backups 128

See `Create a Pool`_ for detail on specifying the number of placement groups for
your pools, and `Placement Groups`_ for details on the number of placement
groups you should set for your pools.

.. _Create a Pool: ../../rados/operations/pools#createpool
.. _Placement Groups: ../../rados/operations/placement-groups


Configure OpenStack Ceph Clients
================================

The nodes running ``glance-api``, ``cinder-volume``, ``nova-compute`` and ``cinder-backup`` act as Ceph clients. Each
requires the ``ceph.conf`` file::

  ssh {your-openstack-server} sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.conf </etc/ceph/ceph.conf

Install Ceph client packages
----------------------------

On the ``glance-api`` node, you'll need the Python bindings for ``librbd``::

  sudo apt-get install python-ceph
  sudo yum install python-ceph

On the ``nova-compute``, ``cinder-backup`` and on the ``cinder-volume`` node, use both
the Python bindings and the client command line tools::

  sudo apt-get install ceph-common
  sudo yum install ceph


Setup Ceph Client Authentication
--------------------------------

If you have `cephx authentication`_ enabled, create a new user for Nova/Cinder
and Glance. Execute the following::

    ceph auth get-or-create client.cinder mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, allow rwx pool=volumes, allow rx pool=images'
    ceph auth get-or-create client.glance mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, allow rwx pool=images'
    ceph auth get-or-create client.cinder-backup mon 'allow r' osd 'allow class-read object_prefix rbd_children, allow rwx pool=backups'

Add the keyrings for ``client.cinder``, ``client.glance``, and ``client.cinder-backup`` to the appropriate
nodes and change their ownership::

  ceph auth get-or-create client.glance | ssh {your-glance-api-server} sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.client.glance.keyring
  ssh {your-glance-api-server} sudo chown glance:glance /etc/ceph/ceph.client.glance.keyring
  ceph auth get-or-create client.cinder | ssh {your-volume-server} sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.client.cinder.keyring
  ssh {your-cinder-volume-server} sudo chown cinder:cinder /etc/ceph/ceph.client.cinder.keyring
  ceph auth get-or-create client.cinder-backup | ssh {your-cinder-backup-server} sudo tee /etc/ceph/ceph.client.cinder-backup.keyring
  ssh {your-cinder-backup-server} sudo chown cinder:cinder /etc/ceph/ceph.client.cinder-backup.keyring

Nodes running ``nova-compute`` need the keyring file for the ``nova-compute`` process. They
also need to store the secret key of the ``client.cinder`` user in ``libvirt``. The libvirt
process needs it to access the cluster while attaching a block device from Cinder.

Create a temporary copy of the secret
key on the nodes running ``nova-compute``::

  ceph auth get-key client.cinder | ssh {your-compute-node} tee client.cinder.key

Then, on the compute nodes, add the secret key to ``libvirt`` and remove the
temporary copy of the key::

  uuidgen
  457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337

  cat > secret.xml <<EOF
  <secret ephemeral='no' private='no'>
    <uuid>457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337</uuid>
    <usage type='ceph'>
      <name>client.cinder secret</name>
    </usage>
  </secret>
  EOF
  sudo virsh secret-define --file secret.xml
  Secret 457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337 created
  sudo virsh secret-set-value --secret 457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337 --base64 $(cat client.cinder.key) && rm client.cinder.key secret.xml

Save the uuid of the secret for configuring ``nova-compute`` later.

.. important:: You don't necessarily need the UUID on all the compute nodes. However from a platform consistency perspective it's better to keep the same UUID.

.. _cephx authentication: ../../rados/operations/authentication


Configure OpenStack to use Ceph
===============================

Configuring Glance
------------------

Glance can use multiple back ends to store images. To use Ceph block devices by
default, edit ``/etc/glance/glance-api.conf`` and add::

    default_store=rbd
    rbd_store_user=glance
    rbd_store_pool=images

If want to enable copy-on-write cloning of images into
volumes, also add::

    show_image_direct_url=True

Note that this exposes the back end location via Glanceâ€™s API, so the endpoint
with this option enabled should not be publicly accessible.


Configuring Cinder
------------------

OpenStack requires a driver to interact with Ceph block devices. You must also
specify the pool name for the block device. On your OpenStack node,
edit ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` by adding::

    volume_driver=cinder.volume.drivers.rbd.RBDDriver
    rbd_pool=volumes
    rbd_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
    rbd_flatten_volume_from_snapshot=false
    rbd_max_clone_depth=5
    glance_api_version=2

If you're using `cephx authentication`_, also configure the user and
uuid of the secret you added to ``libvirt`` as documented earlier::

    rbd_user=cinder
    rbd_secret_uuid=457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337


Configuring Cinder Backup
-------------------------

OpenStack Cinder Backup requires a specific daemon so don't forget to install it.
On your Cinder Backup node, edit ``/etc/cinder/cinder.conf`` and add::

    backup_driver=cinder.backup.drivers.ceph
    backup_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
    backup_ceph_user=cinder-backup
    backup_ceph_chunk_size=134217728
    backup_ceph_pool=backups
    backup_ceph_stripe_unit=0
    backup_ceph_stripe_count=0
    restore_discard_excess_bytes=true


Configuring Nova
----------------

In order to boot all the virtual machines directly into Ceph Nova must be configured.
On every Compute nodes, edit ``/etc/nova/nova.conf`` and add::

    libvirt_images_type=rbd
    libvirt_images_rbd_pool=volumes
    libvirt_images_rbd_ceph_conf=/etc/ceph/ceph.conf
    rbd_user=cinder
    rbd_secret_uuid=457eb676-33da-42ec-9a8c-9293d545c337

It is also a good practice to disable any file injection.
Usually, while booting an instance Nova attempts to open the rootfs of the virtual machine.
Then, it injects directly into the filesystem things like: password, ssh keys etc...
At this point, it is better to rely on the metadata service and cloud-init.
On every Compute nodes, edit ``/etc/nova/nova.conf`` and add::

    libvirt_inject_password=false
    libvirt_inject_key=false
    libvirt_inject_partition=-2


Restart OpenStack
=================

To activate the Ceph block device driver and load the block device pool name
into the configuration, you must restart OpenStack. Thus, for Debian based systems
execute these commands on the appropriate nodes::

    sudo glance-control api restart
    sudo service nova-compute restart
    sudo service cinder-volume restart
    sudo service cinder-backup restart

For Red Hat based systems execute::

    sudo service openstack-glance-api restart
    sudo service openstack-nova-compute restart
    sudo service openstack-cinder-volume restart
    sudo service openstack-cinder-backup restart

Once OpenStack is up and running, you should be able to create a volume
and boot from it.


Booting from a Block Device
===========================

You can create a volume from an image using the Cinder command line tool::

    cinder create --image-id {id of image} --display-name {name of volume} {size of volume}

Note that image must be raw format. You can use `qemu-img`_ to convert
from one format to another, i.e.::

    qemu-img convert -f qcow2 -O raw precise-cloudimg.img precise-cloudimg.raw

When Glance and Cinder are both using Ceph block devices, the image is a
copy-on-write clone, so volume creation is very fast.

In the OpenStack dashboard you can then boot from that volume by launching a new
instance, choosing the image that you created the volume from, and selecting
'boot from volume' and the volume you created.
